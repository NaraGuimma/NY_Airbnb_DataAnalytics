These two projects were done using Kaggle dataset.

Both datasets were evaluated in order to understand the behavior and correlation among the data available. 

By studying them meticulously, it was possible to extract very interesting conclusions of each one.

It was used jupyter notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/) and the main libraries were:

* panda
* matplot.lib
* seaborn
